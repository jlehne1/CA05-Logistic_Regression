# CA05-Logistic_Regression

This repository contains the code and results for CA05.

The assignment looks at CVD Risk and features that may help in predicting if someone is at risk or not at risk using a Logistic Regression model.  The first part of the assignment was to create a binary classifier using Logistic Regression that would allow us to predict if someone would be at risk or not.  The second part was to analyze the importance of the features in the dataset.  The third and final part of this assignment was to create an ROC curve to analyze the performance of the model.  

Details about the code can be found in-line as comments.
